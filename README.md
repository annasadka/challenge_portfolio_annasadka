<p>Hi, my name is Ania. I decided to take part in the project because I love new challenges and I would like to finally do what I like. Since the beginning of my career, I've been drawn towards "tinkering" with websites, testing mobile applications and various software, which I kind of managed to do in my previous positions, although they weren't IT-related. And I always wanted to do more of this, but the other responsibilities of my position didn't allow me to. My aim is to build up a portfolio so that I can confidently start applying for jobs in this profession.</p>

### Subtask 4
<ol>
  <li><b>What is this application about? What is it used for?</b> <br> The app is used to record matches between teams and their results.</li><br>
  <li><b>What functionalities are included in the application? What are they used for. Are they intuitive, or would you change something?</b><br>login, adding players, adding matches and their results, creating reports, summary panel of the number of players, matches, reports and actions entered, contact with the dev team, recent activity</li><br>
  <li><b>Evaluate the application interface (appearance) - do you like it or not?</b><br>- The app's interface gives the impression of being very chaotic. At first it is not clear where to look, where to start and what the application is actually for. I suggest tidying up the home page and adopting standard practices in the visual and information hierarchy.<br>- What I find missing from the menu is what is in the middle of the panel, i.e. links to add players, contact dev team, reports. I suggest expanding the menu to include the features the site has. <br>- The logo and description of the application are in a non-standard place, i.e. not on the top left, but next to the menu, almost in the middle of the page, which adds to the impression of chaos. I suggest moving it to the indicated location.<br>- The application is so simple and has so few functions that learning how it works is a matter of a few minutes for a person with no disabilities. If you have a visual impairment, for example, it can be cumbersome. I suggest tidying up the home page and adding a guide.<br>- No option to add a match without adding a new player.<br>- There is no option to verify that the data entered is correct, i.e. that the infomation is true.<br>- The option to change the language is in a non-standard place. I suggest changing it to the right hand corner.<br>- On the homepage I would add information about which teams played against each other and the result of the match. <br>- In addition to this, I would add a section showing which team has won the most matches, which player has scored the most goals. <br>- It might be tempting to add photographs of the players and to add information on what minute a goal was scored and by whom.<br> - The panel with the number of players etc. could be clickable and redirect to a page with detailed information.</li>
  <li><b>Is the application intuitive? (Intuitive, i.e., for example, you have no problem understanding what to click to enter the form to add a new football player to the system).</b><br>I had to think for a while before I understood what the app was for. In my opinion, it is not intuitive, or at least there is a lot of room for improvement, as I have pointed out above.</li>
  <li><b>Do you notice any mistakes? Or something seems wrong to you? Write down your thoughts in a file. Here you have the space, time and space to do so! ;)</b><br>Yes, I notice :)<br>- English names appear in the Polish version.<br>- In the player's edition the level of play, Main position and alternate position should be a list of choices. At present, anything can be entered, which makes for nonsense in the reports.<br>- In my opinion it is a mistake not to be able to add a match without adding a player.<br>- In the report, the teams are Objects, and they should have their own names. Without that the report is worthless.<br>- There are several errors in the console including 404. I have included a picture below.</li>
