### Subtask 1
<p>10/10. yeah!</p>

### Subtask 3

<details>
<summary>Hi, my name is Ania... :point_right: Click here and read more! :blush:</summary><br>
  <p>I decided to take part in the project because<b> I love new challenges</b> and I would like to finally do what I like. Since the beginning of my career, I've been drawn towards "tinkering" with websites, testing mobile applications and various software, which I kind of managed to do in my previous positions, although they weren't IT-related. And I always wanted to do more of this, but the other responsibilities of my position didn't allow me to. My aim is to build up a portfolio so that I can confidently start applying for jobs in this profession.</p>:muscle:
</details>

### Subtask 4
<details>
  <summary> Click here to find out what I think of the app after seeing it for the first time :innocent:</summary><br>
 
  <details>
    <summary><b>What is this application about? What is it used for?</b><br> Click for answer!	:point_left:</summary> <br> 
    <p>The app is used to record matches between teams and their results.</p>
   <br>
    </details>

 <details>
<summary><b>What functionalities are included in the application?</b><br> Click for answer!	:point_left:<br></summary>
  <br>
<ol>
  <li>login,</li>
  <li>adding players, </li>
  <li>adding matches and their results, </li>
  <li>creating reports, </li>
  <li>summary panel of the number of players, matches, reports and actions entered, </li>
  <li>contact with the dev team, </li>
  <li>recent activity.</li>
  </ol>
<br>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Evaluate the application interface (appearance) - do you like it or not?</b><br> Click for answer!	:point_left:</summary><br>
  
<ul>
<li>The app's interface gives the impression of being very chaotic. At first it is not clear where to look, where to start and what the application is actually for. I suggest tidying up the home page and adopting standard practices in the visual and information hierarchy.</li><br>
  
<li>What I find missing from the menu is what is in the middle of the panel, i.e. links to add players, contact dev team, reports. I suggest expanding the menu to include the features the site has.</li><br>
  
<li>The logo and description of the application are in a non-standard place, i.e. not on the top left, but next to the menu, almost in the middle of the page, which adds to the impression of chaos. I suggest moving it to the indicated location.</li><br>
  
<li>The application is so simple and has so few functions that learning how it works is a matter of a few minutes for a person with no disabilities. If you have a visual impairment, for example, it can be cumbersome. I suggest tidying up the home page and adding a guide.</li><br>
  
<li>No option to add a match without adding a new player.</li><br>
  
<li>There is no option to verify that the data entered is correct, i.e. that the infomation is true.</li><br>

<li>The option to change the language is in a non-standard place. I suggest changing it to the right hand corner.</li><br>
  
<li>On the homepage I would add information about which teams played against each other and the result of the match.</li> <br>
  
<li>In addition to this, I would add a section showing which team has won the most matches, which player has scored the most goals.</li> <br>
  
<li>It might be tempting to add photographs of the players and to add information on what minute a goal was scored and by whom.</li><br> 
  
<li>The panel with the number of players etc. could be clickable and redirect to a page with detailed information.</li><br>
  </ul>
  <br>
  </details>
  
<details>
  <summary><b>Is the application intuitive? </b><br> Click for answer!	:point_left:</summary><br>
  
  <p>I had to think for a while before I understood what the app was for. In my opinion, it is not intuitive, or at least there is a lot of room for improvement, as I have pointed out above.</p>
  <br>
  </details>
  
  <details>
  <summary><b>Do you notice any mistakes?</b><br> Click for answer!!	:point_left:</summary><br>
  
  <p>Yes, I do :face_with_spiral_eyes:<br></p>
  <ul>
    <li>English names appear in the Polish version.</li><br>
    <li>In the player's edition the level of play, Main position and alternate position should be a list of choices. At present, anything can be entered, which makes for nonsense in the reports.</li><br>
    <li>In my opinion it is a mistake not to be able to add a match without adding a player.</li><br> 
    <li>In the report, the teams are Objects, and they should have their own names. Without that the report is worthless.</li><br>
    <li>There are several errors in the console including 404. I have included a picture. <a href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122752057/213030604-b4c220bc-d710-452b-9e7e-7f459aebc489.png">Click!</a></li>

Buyers, sellers of goods, employers and jobseekers as well as landlords and property sellers/buyers.
